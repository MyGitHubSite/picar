\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We present a low cost autonomous vehicle platform that uses state-of-the art AI techniques and 
technologies. It employs a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to effectively 
navigate the car by predicting the steering angle given an input frame. We have tested the real time 
efficacy of our platform and found that it is capable of performing inferencing operations within a WCET 
of 50 ms, or 20 fps, when a single model is run on more than one core. Further studies should be 
conducted on the interference that occurs between cores to allow for improved performance in utilizing 
multiple models for autonomous vehicles. With minimal further research, the DeepPicar can 
become a valudable, reliable and inexpensive tool in the continued research of autonomous vehicles.
